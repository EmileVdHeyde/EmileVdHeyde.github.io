## Text Analysis for Moderation of posted comments using Deep Learning

[Back to Project List](http://emilevdheyde.github.io/)

**Project Description:** 

This project is a classification model, using a Neural Network algorithm to identify if a post should be accepted or rejected because it contains a high possibility of abusive, discriminatory language or it being potential spam.  

The model uses a rich sample of publicly available blog comments and classifies them using Tensor flow and Keras.
A bi-directional convoluted Neural net algorism was used to model the accept and reject classification.

The model was then saved and a package was created for with flask and deployed on heroku.  

It is available to demo at the following link.
